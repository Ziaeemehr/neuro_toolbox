# neuro_toolbox
*HEADER FILES* only C++ library for analysis of *neurophysiological* and *simulated* data.

for auto-generated **documentation** you need to have `doxygen` installed on your machine.

```shell
# on linux machines use
sudo pat-get install doxygen
cd doc
doxygen 
```

which produce `html` file. 

## installation 

There is no need for installation. It's a header file only library. You just need to put the header files in a directory and pass the address of the directory to the make file or directly pass it to the terminal using `-I PATH_TO_HEADER_FILES`.
